# DownloadVideo(Windows)
Download video via Chrome ,Tampermonkey and ffmpeg
the script.html is not mine，instead from CSDN.
You need to install ffmpeg , Tampermonkey for Chrome or other browser(NO 360!!OR YOU WILL REGRET HAHAHA:)
PLS paste script.html into Tampermonkey, then open a website，waiting until the video is at an end， and DL
You will get TWO mp4，one only contains video，and another only contains sound.
Select both the mp4，move the mouse onto the video mp4，press left mouse to drag them onto the paste.bat.
At last，you will get 'output.mp4'.Do not forget to rename it:)
